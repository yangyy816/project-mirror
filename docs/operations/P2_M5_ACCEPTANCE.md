# P2-M5 Acceptance Evidence

## Status

- Milestone: `P2-M5 — Variable Isolation, Duplicate and Diversity QA`
- State: `EXECUTING`
- Entry baseline: `5f2680e4d0724b409e13ac9cbe318b144cb0375f`
- Entry migration head: `0013_warp_plan_authority`
- Public API change: none
- M6 entry: closed pending technical Gate and P2-MVR-v1 PASS

This is an acceptance skeleton. `PENDING` is not PASS evidence.

## Entry evidence

- Local and remote P2-M4 freeze-state are `5f2680e4d0724b409e13ac9cbe318b144cb0375f`.
- GitHub Actions run `32171351357`, attempt 2, passed `quality-and-integration`, `secret-scan` and
  `docker-validation` on that exact SHA.
- Seven artifacts are present, readable, unexpired and exact-SHA bound. The frozen regression JSON reports migration
  head `0013_warp_plan_authority`, unchanged OpenAPI digest and zero M1/M2/M3 failures/errors/skips. Gitleaks SARIF
  contains zero results.
- Attempt 1 was cancelled after a 35-minute Playwright Chromium download stall; attempt 2 completed the same step in
  68 seconds without repository changes. This is bounded external-download evidence, not a product repair.
- P2-M4 remains `FROZEN`; `jaw_width` remains `EXPERIMENTAL` and N=2 remains
  `FURTHER_RESEARCH_FOR_M5_ISOLATION`.
- The tracked worktree was clean at branch creation except protected existing `.tmp/`, which remains outside scope.

## T01 acceptance

- ADR-041 freezes separate technical/MVR results, immutable `SyntheticEvaluationPolicy`, new ontology-version
  `region_group`, per-dimension cluster-adjusted holdout N, 24→48→96 stop rules, first-party SHA/pHash/Hamming and
  append-only isolation/duplicate/diversity authority.
- `P2_M5_EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` freezes the evaluation order and mandatory negative controls without fabricating
  missing cohort or thresholds.
- `P2_M5_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md` defines T01–T08, collision domains, validation, Repair protocol and closure sequence.
- No code, migration, dependency, model/image artifact, public API or holdout result is added by T01.
- Owner download authorization is retained as permission for task-required private acquisition only; it is not
  adoption, license, distribution, production or real-user processing approval.

`P2_M5_T01: PASS`

`P2_M5_STATE: EXECUTION_READY`

`P2_M5_TECHNICAL_GATE: PENDING`

`P2_MVR_V1_RESULT: NOT_EVALUATED`

`P2_M6_ENTRY: CLOSED`

## T01 tracked acceptance

- Candidate `a39d9763f3a907bc7824994cd92fbe5c319b3acc` completed GitHub Actions run `32176583182` with
  `quality-and-integration`, `secret-scan` and `docker-validation` successful.
- Seven artifacts are present, readable and exact-SHA bound. Phase 1/M1/M2/M3 evidence reports
  1/98/52/46 tests with zero failures and skips, current migration head `0013_warp_plan_authority`, and the unchanged
  OpenAPI digest. Gitleaks SARIF contains zero results.
- The Playwright download completed successfully in 3 minutes 34 seconds. No product repair, retry or Gate waiver was
  used.
- Principal accepts T01 and advances M5 to `EXECUTING`. T02 and T04 are open with disjoint collision domains; T03
  remains dependency-gated on their integrated contract names.
- This acceptance does not approve any MVR threshold, dimension promotion, new dependency, production geometry,
  real-user facial processing or QuestionBank release.

`P2_M5_T01_TRACKED_ACCEPTANCE: PASS`

`P2_M5_STATE: EXECUTING`

## T02 local candidate

- Added a pure first-party M5 domain module with no ORM, HTTP, storage, task-runner, image-library or Provider import.
- `SyntheticEvaluationPolicy` has an independent schema/digest, fixed 24→48→96 cohort stages and sorted immutable
  per-dimension rules. Region groups reject sensitive, beauty, population and age/sexual classification tokens.
- Cohort assignments reject identity/Asset/checksum/duplicate-cluster leakage across calibration, M4-seen and holdout;
  effective N is computed per dimension and counts one unit per duplicate cluster.
- Isolation evaluation retains actual signed requested/measured target delta, target error, all control deltas,
  non-target drift, repeat/platform variance, automatic hard-gate failures and deterministic report digest.
- `TechnicalGateResult` and `MvrResult` are separate types; technical PASS with `FURTHER_RESEARCH` is valid, while
  technical FAIL with MVR PASS is rejected.
- 41 new tests and 101 adjacent domain tests passed. Ruff format/lint covered all 207 service files, strict mypy passed
  123 source files, generated contracts had zero drift, and `git diff --check` passed.
- This is `READY_FOR_TRACKED_EVIDENCE`, not T02 acceptance. No ORM/migration, dependency, threshold/holdout value,
  image/model artifact, public API or production/real-user capability was added.

`P2_M5_T02: READY_FOR_TRACKED_EVIDENCE`

## T02 tracked acceptance

- Candidate `9fb09fbc922406d5881950f355629c3108656a24` run `32178257563` passed
  `quality-and-integration`, `secret-scan` and `docker-validation` on the exact candidate SHA.
- Seven downloaded artifacts are present and readable. Phase 1/M1/M2/M3 evidence binds the exact candidate,
  migration head `0013_warp_plan_authority` and unchanged OpenAPI digest; the suites report 1/98/52/46 tests with
  zero failures, errors or skips. Gitleaks SARIF contains zero results.
- Principal accepts T02 domain, isolation and split contracts. This acceptance does not select a tolerance,
  near-duplicate threshold, holdout cohort, dimension promotion or MVR result, and it does not authorize production
  geometry, real-user facial processing or QuestionBank release.
- T04 remains independently open. T03 stays dependency-gated until the T04 signature contract receives tracked
  acceptance and Principal integrates both contract surfaces.

`P2_M5_T02_TRACKED_ACCEPTANCE: PASS`

## T04 local candidate

- Added a first-party, versioned `SimilaritySignature` over checksum-bound canonical synthetic JPEG bytes with exact
  normalized SHA-256, a deterministic 64-bit `phash-dct-nearest-v1` value and threshold-free Hamming distance.
- Exact SHA equality is the only automatic duplicate hard gate. The implementation contains no near-duplicate
  threshold, clustering decision or automatic near-duplicate rejection.
- Malformed, checksum-mismatched, wrong-shape, oversized and tampered inputs fail closed without echoing image bytes,
  paths or caller content. The existing bounded canonical JPEG decode boundary is reused.
- Eleven focused tests passed on Windows and Linux Docker. Both platforms produced golden pHash
  `a00d812ea37eff0b`; 124 combined adjacent tests, Ruff over 209 service files, strict mypy over 124 sources,
  contract drift and `git diff --check` passed.
- No dependency, model, network path, ORM/migration, public API, tracked image fixture or automatic policy threshold
  was added. `imagededup` remains rejected.

`P2_M5_T04: READY_FOR_TRACKED_EVIDENCE`

## T04 tracked acceptance

- Candidate `c80f32f6adb0c1ed17ac14e97b5552739abec57c` run `32179065826` passed
  `quality-and-integration`, `secret-scan` and `docker-validation` on the exact candidate SHA.
- Seven downloaded artifacts are present and readable. Phase 1/M1/M2/M3 evidence binds the exact candidate,
  migration head `0013_warp_plan_authority` and unchanged OpenAPI digest; the suites report 1/98/52/46 tests with
  zero failures, errors or skips. Gitleaks SARIF contains zero results.
- Principal accepts T04. The similarity contract contains no selected threshold and cannot automatically reject a
  near-duplicate before a future evaluation-policy version is preregistered.
- T02 and T04 names/contracts are now integrated. T03 is authorized to implement only the frozen forward
  `0014_m5_eval_authority` PostgreSQL authority; T05–T08, MVR evaluation and M6 release remain closed.

`P2_M5_T04_TRACKED_ACCEPTANCE: PASS`

`P2_M5_NEXT_TASK: T03_AUTHORIZED`

## T04 acceptance checkpoint

- Acceptance checkpoint `8640879c586afcbf72c9ea1e67bef82992525bdd` run `32179662032` passed all three
  jobs. Seven downloaded artifacts bind the exact checkpoint and migration head `0013_warp_plan_authority`;
  Phase 1/M1/M2/M3 evidence remains at 1/98/52/46 tests with zero failures, errors or skips, and Gitleaks reports
  zero results.
- This closes the T02/T04 contract-integration checkpoint and leaves only T03 authorized. It does not advance the M5
  technical Gate or MVR result.

`P2_M5_T02_T04_CONTRACT_CHECKPOINT: PASS`

## T03 local candidate and P2-M5-R01

- Added forward migration `0014_variable_isolation_coverage.py` with revision `0014_m5_eval_authority`; historical
  migrations `0001`–`0013` remain unchanged. The ORM and PostgreSQL schema add immutable evaluation policy/rules,
  cohort assignments, isolation reports, similarity signatures/pairs, duplicate clusters/memberships/decisions and
  diversity reports without a User relation or public API change.
- PostgreSQL recomputes policy, signature and isolation-result digests; binds isolation reports to completed M4
  transforms and passed variant QA; derives target error, non-target drift, conclusion and reason codes; rejects
  mutation, split leakage, unqualified assets, fabricated facts and prohibited beauty/sensitive authority.
- `P2-M5-R01` closes bounded implementation defects found during Principal review: qualified cluster membership,
  authoritative digest/derived-fact validation, serialization of cluster/finalization/split races, four stale
  migration-head regression assertions and a driver-dependent exact-duplicate concurrency test expectation.
- A fresh PostgreSQL run passed all 14 T03 authority tests. The exact-duplicate race passed ten consecutive replays;
  the complete Linux API/Worker suite collected 566 tests and completed at 100% with only existing optional
  environment-gated skips. Fresh upgrade, `0013→0014→0013→0014` and both `alembic check` runs passed.
- Ruff format/lint passed all 211 service files, strict mypy passed 124 source files, `pnpm.cmd check` passed 54 Web
  tests and the production build, generated contracts had zero drift, and `git diff --check` passed.
- This candidate remains `READY_FOR_TRACKED_EVIDENCE`. Exact-SHA GitHub Actions, seven artifact inspection and
  Principal acceptance are still mandatory before T03 PASS or T05 entry. No threshold, cohort, holdout, MVR result,
  dependency/model adoption, production geometry, real-user processing or QuestionBank release is approved.

`P2_M5_T03: READY_FOR_TRACKED_EVIDENCE`

`P2_M5_R01: LOCAL_PASS_PENDING_TRACKED_EVIDENCE`

`P2_M5_NEXT_TASK: T03_TRACKED_EVIDENCE`

## T03 tracked acceptance

- Candidate `277c69aad491e31241142990d94b843fd7b18700` run `32186155269` passed
  `quality-and-integration`, `secret-scan` and `docker-validation` on the exact candidate SHA.
- Seven artifacts are present, readable and unexpired. Phase 1/M1/M2/M3 evidence binds the exact SHA, migration head
  `0014_m5_eval_authority` and unchanged OpenAPI digest; the suites report 1/98/52/46 tests with zero failures,
  errors or skips. Gitleaks SARIF contains zero results.
- Docker and Celery logs contain no execution error; the only case-insensitive `error` match is Redis module
  configuration field `bf-error-rate`. License inventories and the 105-component Python SBOM are readable.
- Principal accepts T03 and R01. This acceptance establishes database authority only; it does not preregister a
  threshold or cohort, execute holdout/MVR, approve a new dependency/model, enable production geometry or real-user
  processing, or authorize QuestionBank release.
- T05 opens only for calibration/cohort/preregistration. T06–T08, the technical Gate, MVR result and M6 remain
  closed/pending.
